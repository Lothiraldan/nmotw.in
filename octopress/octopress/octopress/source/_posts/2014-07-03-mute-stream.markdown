> Bytes go in, but they don't come out (when muted).

[mute-stream](https://www.npmjs.org/package/mute-stream) as the name says it mutes the stream, as in it's a pass-through stream, but when muted, the bytes are silently dropped, rather than being passed through.

__Installing it:__ `npm install mute-stream`


__Example usage:__

```javascript
var ms = new (require('mute-stream'))({});

ms.pipe(process.stdout);

ms.write('Shout\n');
ms.mute();
ms.write('Shout louder!\n');
ms.unmute();
ms.write('Phew!\n');

```

`({})` is the options part, that can be either of:

* replace => Replaces the muted string with the specified string. (Check the gif)

* prompt =>  prompt with a readline stream, to avoid backspace overwrites.

It also provides `ms.muted()` method to check if the stream is already muted.

> The MuteStream object acts as a facade to its pipe source and destination.

__GIF FTW!__
