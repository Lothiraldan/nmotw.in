[RSVP](https://www.npmjs.org/package/rsvp) : A lightweight library that provides tools for organizing asynchronous code.

This module gives a tiny implementation of [Promises/A+](http://promises-aplus.github.com/promises-spec/).

As usual do a `npm install rsvp` to get the module.

__Basic Usage:__

```javascript
var RSVP = require('rsvp');

var promise = new RSVP.Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
  // succeed
  resolve(value);
  // or reject
  reject(error);
});

promise.then(function(value) {
  // success
}, function(value) {
  // failure
});
```

Once a promise has been resolved or rejected, it cannot be resolved or rejected again.

It give some more goddies like:

* Chaining

* Easy Error Handling.

* Compatible with [TaskJS](http://taskjs.org/).

So, what are you waiting for? Go got it and have fun!
