#[cowsay](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cowsay)
>A configurable talking cow!

This is a port of  Tony Monroe's `cowsay` Perl module.

__GET IT:__ `npm install --global cowsay` 

__CLI:__

```
cowsay 
Usage: cowsay [-e eye_string] [-f cowfile] [-h] [-l] [-n] [-T tongue_string] [-W column] [-bdgpstwy] text

If any command-line arguments are left over after all switches have been processed, they become the cow's message.

If the program is invoked as cowthink then the cow will think its message instead of saying it.

Options:
  -b  Mode: Borg

  -y  Mode: Youthful                                                                                                                              
  -e  Select the appearance of the cow's eyes.                                                                                                      [default: "oo"]
  -T  The tongue is configurable similarly to the eyes through -T and tongue_string.                                                                [default: "  "]
  -h  Display this help message                                                                                                                   
  -n  If it is specified, the given message will not be word-wrapped.                                                                             
  -W  Specifies roughly where the message should be wrapped. The default is equivalent to -W 40 i.e. wrap words at or before the 40th column.       [default: 40]
  -f  Specifies a cow picture file (''cowfile'') to use. It can be either a path to a cow file or the name of one of cows included in the package.  [default: "default"]
  -l  List all cowfiles included in this package.
