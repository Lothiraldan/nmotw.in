If you scroll back to top, elements will animate to it's previous state and are ready to animate again if you scroll down.

```html
<div data-aos="animation_name"/>
```

const aos = require('aos');
aos.init();
```

Major set of animations: Fade, Flip, Slide, Zoom, Easing functions and anchor placements.
