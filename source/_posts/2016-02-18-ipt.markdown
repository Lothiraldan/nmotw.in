#[ipt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ipt)
> The missing shell interactive workflow.

`ipt` (pronounced iPipeTo) introduces the missing cli interactive workflow. 

It takes any kind of list as an input and uses that list to build an interactive interface to let you select an element from it.

Stop manually dragging your mouse around to copy output data from a terminal, using the ipt workflow you can pipe data from a command and select what to copy to clipboard from a convenient visual menu.

Selected data is also output to stdout allowing for easily composing various workflows - Just create your custom alias!

P.S: Couldn't explain it better than than author! 


__GET IT:__ `npm install -g ipt`

__Sample usage:__

```sh
git branch -a | ipt | xargs git checkout
```

```sh
git --no-pager log --oneline | ipt | cut -d ' ' -f 1 | xargs -o git rebase -i"
```

P.S: Don't miss to read the wonderful [examples](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ipt#examples)!

__GIF FTW!__
