[exenv](http://npm.im/exenv)
> React's ExecutionEnvironment module extracted.

Many modules and components out there in the wild, uses React's private `ExecutionEnvironment` lib for feature detection, like:

```js
canUseDOM = require('react/lib/ExecutionEnvironment').canUseDOM; // BAD
```

Which is not a good practice as private libs are prone to modification or deletion, so [Jed Watson](http://www.thinkmill.com.au) has created
`exenv` for us.

P.S: `isInWorker` has been left out as it's very specific to react.

__Install it:__ `npm install --save exenv`

__Sample usage:__

```js
var exenv = require('exenv');
console.log(exenv);
//Object {canUseDOM: true, canUseWorkers: true, canUseEventListeners: true, canUseViewport: true}
```

__GIF FTW!__
