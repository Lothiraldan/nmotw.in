[pressure](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pressure)
> Handle Force Touch, 3D Touch, and Pointer Pressure on the web.

Devices implement force differently `pressure` is trying to solve it across all devices, with polyfill and multi touch support.

__Get it:__ `npm install pressure`

__Sample usage:__

```js
const Pressure = require('pressure');

Pressure.set('#element', {
  start: function(event){
    // this is called on force start
  },
  end: function(){
    // this is called on force end
  },
  startDeepPress: function(event){
    // this is called on "force click" / "deep press", aka once the force is greater than 0.5
  },
  endDeepPress: function(){
    // this is called when the "force click" / "deep press" end
  },
  change: function(force, event){
    // this is called every time there is a change in pressure
    // force will always be a value from 0 to 1 on mobile and desktop
  },
  unsupported: function(){
    // NOTE: this is only called if the polyfill option is disabled!
    // this is called once there is a touch on the element and the device or browser does not support Force or 3D touch
  }
});
```

Below are the supported devices:
