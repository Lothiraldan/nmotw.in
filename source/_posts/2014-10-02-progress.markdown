# progress
> Flexible ascii progress bar.

__Install it:__ `npm install progress`

__Example usage:__

* Create a ProgressBar.
* Give it a format string. 
* Give the total, telling the progress bar when to stop!
* Finally do tick() appropriately.

```javascript
var ProgressBar = require('progress');

var bar = new ProgressBar(':bar', { total: 10 });
var timer = setInterval(function () {
  bar.tick();
  if (bar.complete) {
    console.log('\ncomplete\n');
    clearInterval(timer);
  }
}, 100);
```

### Options

These are keys in the options object you can pass to the progress bar along with
`total` as seen in the example above.

- `total` total number of ticks to complete
- `width` the displayed width of the progress bar defaulting to total
- `stream` the output stream defaulting to stderr
- `complete` completion character defaulting to "="
- `incomplete` incomplete character defaulting to "-"
- `clear` option to clear the bar on completion defaulting to false
- `callback` optional function to call when the progress bar completes

### Tokens

These are tokens you can use in the format of your progress bar.

- `:bar` the progress bar itself
- `:current` current tick number
- `:total` total ticks
- `:elapsed` time elapsed in seconds
- `:percent` completion percentage
- `:eta` estimated completion time in seconds
