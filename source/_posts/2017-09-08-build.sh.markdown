#[build.sh](https://www.npmjs.com/package/build.sh)
> ðŸ”¨ run and visualize the build process.

`build.sh` is one of those unquie node module which likes to take an atypical route in solving problems, this module helps in running and visualize the build process, makes use of `build.yml` at the root of your project for the build pipleline meta-data.

__Get it:__ `npm install -g build.sh`

__Sample usage:__

```sh
$ build [options]


Options:

  -V, --version        output the version number
  -c, --config [file]  the input file for the build pipeline to run
  -d, --debug          outputs a debug file of the build process and data captured
  -h, --help           output usage information
```

To invoke about the pipeline simply run `build` at the project root. The terminal output will show the pipeline being run and eventually will open the browser to the location of the final report.

```sh
# cat .build.yml

pipeline:
  {key}:
    - {command}
    - {command}
```

__Sample `.build.yml`:__

```yaml
output: ./docs
pipeline:
  install:
    - npm --version
    - node --version
    - npm:
      - npm install
      - ls -lh node_modules
  lint:
    - npm run lint
  coverage:
    - npm run coverage
  test:
    - npm test
  docs:
    - npm run generate-docs
```
