#[jsvu](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsvu)
>JavaScript (engine) Version Updater.

`jsvu` makes it easy to fetch the latest versions of JavaScript engines for a specific OS, without the hassels of compiling them!

__Get it:__

```
npm install -g jsvu
```

```sh
# in your ~/*.rc
export PATH="${HOME}/.jsvu:${PATH}"
```

```sh
jsvu
```

It's prompts for the OS and the engine and install them based on your choice, it can install Chakra/ChakraCore, JavaScriptCore, SpiderMonk
ey and V8 for you.

__GIF FTW!__
