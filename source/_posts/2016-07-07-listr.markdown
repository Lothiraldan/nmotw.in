#[listr](https://www.npmjs.com/package/listr)
>Terminal task list.

`listr` is one of those cheeky ðŸ’„ modules for your CLI apps.

Below is the gist of this module:

* `listr` accepts an array of tasks, where each task in a object consisting of `title` (string) and `task` (method).

* If a task returns, it means the task was completed succesfully. 

* If a task throws an error, the task failed.

* Task can be async by returning a Promise.

* Task can be an Observable.

* Task can also be a stream, which is in-turn converted to an Observable.

* An instance of `listr` has `add(task)`, `task` and `run` methods. (Names are self explanatory?)


__Get it:__ `npm install --save listr`


__Sample usage:__

```js
const tasks = new Listr([
	{
		title: 'Success',
		task: () => 'Foo'
	},
	{
		title: 'Failure',
		task: () => {
			throw new Error('Bar')
		}
	}
]);
```

```js
tasks.run().catch(err => {
	console.error(err);
});
```
