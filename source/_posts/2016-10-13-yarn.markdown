#[yarn](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yarn)
>FAST, RELIABLE, AND SECURE DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT.

`yarn` let use call it a faster `npm`? Open sourced by facebook, has the below features:

* Offline Mode: If you've installed a package before, you can install it again without any internet connection.
* Deterministic: The same dependencies will be installed the same exact way across every machine regardless of install order.
* Network Performance: Yarn efficiently queues up requests and avoids request waterfalls in order to maximize network utilization.
* Multiple Registries: Install any package from either npm or Bower and keep your package workflow the same.
* Network Resilience: A single request failing won't cause an install to fail. Requests are retried upon failure.
* Flat Mode: Resolve mismatching versions of dependencies to a single version to avoid creating duplicates.
* More emojis. üêà
