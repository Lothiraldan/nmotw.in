# [next.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next)
> Minimalistic framework for server-rendered React applications.

`next.js` framework helps with SSR of React applications and so far has:

- Automatic transpilation and bundling (with webpack and babel)
- Hot code reloading
- Server rendering and indexing of `./pages`
- Static file serving. `./static/` is mapped to `/static/`

__GET IT:__ `npm instll --save next`

__Sample usage:__

```sh
$ mkdir pages
```

```js
//pages/index.js:
import React from 'react'
export default () => <div>Hello Next!</div>
```

Add a script to the `package.json` like:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "next"
  }
}
```

and run:

```
$ npm start
```

__GIF FTW__
