[ramjet](http://npm.im/ramjet)
> Transform DOM elements into each another with smooth transitions

`ramjet` helps us to Morph DOM elements from one state to another with smooth transitions! 

All it does is:

* Clone the elements and all their children.

* Transform the second element so that it completely overlaps with the first.

* Animating the two elements together until the first element has exactly the same position and dimensions as the second element.


__install it:__ `npm install --save ramjet`


__sample usage:__

```html
<div id='a' style='background-color: red; font-size: 4em; padding: 1em;'>a</div>
<div id='b' style='background-color: blue; font-size: 4em; padding: 1em;'>b</div>

<script>
  ramjet.transform( a, b );
</script>
```

__GIF FTW__
