#[ðŸ“¦ esbox]()
>Zero-config REPL for experimenting with next-generation JavaScript.


`esbox` is ES2016 in a box!

__Get it:__ `npm install -g esbox`

* It automatically compiles and re-runs your script every time you save.

* JSBin-like setup for your local editor and terminal â€“ with full access to Node APIs and modules.

* ECMAScript features that Babel supports (stage-0 and above).

* For a number of popular libraries, you can just import them without the need to install them first (Bascially all the dependecies of `esbox`).

__Sample usage:__

```sh
nmotw.in> esbox 

                         
    ðŸ“¦  ES2016 in a box   
       git.io/esbox      
                         

  Usage
    > esbox FILENAME

  Options
    --cwd=DIRECTORY   run in a different directory
    --no-watch        only run your script once
    --no-clear        disable clearing the display before each run
    --version         show esbox version
    --poll            poll file system when watching files
```
