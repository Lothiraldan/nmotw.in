> Despite the constant negative press covfefe.

Time for a fun module this week, it's `covfefe`. (Hope you are aware of [it](https://archive.is/f7UL3)!)

__Get it:__ `npm install covfefe`

__Sample usage:__

```js
> const covfefe = require('covfefe');
 
> covfefe('Despite the constant negative press');
"Despite the constant negative press covfefe"
 
> covfefe.translate('I have good coverage of spray tan');
"I have good covfefe of spray tan"
```

__GIF FTW!__
