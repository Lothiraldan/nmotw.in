#[gtop](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gtop)
>System monitoring dashboard for terminal.

`gtop` could be termed as the node's version of [htop](http://hisham.hm/htop/), gives a very need interface on the cli that would list out the below:

* CPU history.

* Memory and Swap History.

* Memory and Netowrk usage.

* Disk usage.

* Process list.

You can sort the process table by pressing:

`p`: Process Id
`c`: CPU usage
`m`: Memory usage


__Get it:__ `npm install -g gtop`

__Sample usage:__

```
$ gtop

# In case of font issues: LANG=en_US.utf8 TERM=xterm-256color gtop
```

__GIF FTW!__
