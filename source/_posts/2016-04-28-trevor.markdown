#[trevor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/trevor)
>Your own Travis CI to run tests locally.

__From the author:__

I often need to run tests for multiple versions of Node.js. 

But I don't want to switch versions manually using n/nvm or push the code to Travis CI just to run the tests.

That's why I created Trevor. 

It reads `.travis.yml` and runs tests in all versions you requested, just like Travis CI. 

Now, you can test before push and keep your git history clean.


__Get it:__ `npm install --save trevor`

__Sample usage:__

```sh
$ trevor --help

  Your own Travis CI to run tests locally

  Usage: trevor [options]

  Options:

    -h, --help    Show this help
    --no-clean    Don' remove the Docker image after tests

  Required files (in the current directory):

    - package.json
    - .travis.yml
```

P.S: `trevor` has a dependency on [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and if `--no-clean` is not used it will remove all the docker images after the test runs.
