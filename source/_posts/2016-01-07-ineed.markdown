#[ineed](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ineed)
> Web scraping and HTML-reprocessing. The easy way.

`ineed` allows you collect useful data from web pages using simple and nice API.

It doesn't build and traverse DOM-tree, it operates on sequence of HTML tokens instead. Whole processing is done in one-pass, therefore, it's blazing fast! 

__Get it:__ `npm install --save ineed`

__Usage:__ `ineed.<action>[.<plugin>...].<from*>`

Where `action` could be: `collect` or `reprocess`

`plugin` could be one of: `.comments` `.cssCode` `.hyperlinks` `.images` `.jsCode` `.scripts` `.stylesheets` `.texts` `.title`

`from` could be: `from` or `fromHtml`

P.S: One could write a custom plugin using the `.using()` method.

__Code sample:__

```js
var ineed = require('ineed');
 
ineed.collect.images.hyperlinks.scripts.stylesheets.from('http://nmotw.in',
    (err, response, result) => console.log(result));
```

```js
var ineed = require('ineed');

var result = ineed.collect.texts.images.scripts.fromHtml(html);
```

__GIF FTW!__
