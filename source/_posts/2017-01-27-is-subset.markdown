#[is-subset](https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-subset)
> Check if an object is contained within another one.

`is-subset` is a tiny little module that is so very useful! All it does is accepts `superSet` and `maybeSubset` objects and check if the `maybeSubset` is a subset of the `superSet`.

__Get it:__ `npm install --save is-subset`

__Sample usage:__

```js

const isSubset = require('is-subset');


// True;
isSubset(
  {a: 1, b: {c: 3, d: 4}, e: 5},
  {a: 1, b: {c: 3}}
);

//False;
isSubset(
  {a: 1},
  {a: 1, b: 2}
);
```
