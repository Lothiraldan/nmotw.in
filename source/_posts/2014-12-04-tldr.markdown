If you are new to CLI or not able to recall the flags of your CLI tool, you would consult `man pages`. 

`tldr` is "Too Long Didn't Read" version of man pages ;) i.e it shows us the common usages of a given command.

`tldr` covers:

* Common commands.

* GNU/Linux.

* OSX.

* SunOS. 


__Install it as a CLI app:__ ```$ npm install -g tldr```

__Sample usage:__

```sh

$ tldr sudo

  execute a command as another user

  - Listing of an unreadable directory:

  sudo ls /usr/local/scrt

  - To edit a file as user www:

  sudo -u www vi /var/www/index.html

  - To shutdown the machine:

  sudo shutdown -r +10 "Cya soon!"

  - To repeat the last command as sudo

  sudo !!

```

__GIF FTW!__
