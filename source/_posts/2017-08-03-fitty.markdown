#[fitty](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fitty)
> Makes text fit perfectly.

Fitty, Snugly text resizing: Scales up (or down) text so it fits perfectly to its parent container.

The crux is of fitty is the `fit` method which marks the fitty as dirty and requests a redraw (this will also redraw any other fitty marked as dirty).


__Get it:__ `npm install fitty`

__Sample usage:__

```html
const fitty = require('fitty');

fitty('#my-element);
```

Default options:

```js
const defaultOptions = {
  minSize: 16,
  maxSize: 512,
  multiLine: true,
  observeMutations: 'MutationObserver' in w ? mutationObserverDefaultSetting : false
};
```
Yes, it uses `MutationObserver`.

__GIF FTW!__
