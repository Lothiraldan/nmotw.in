There are many wonderful node modules that adhere to Unix philosophy:

> "Write programs that do one thing and do it well."

Out of many such one such elegant module is [chalk](https://www.npmjs.org/package/chalk) thanks to [Sindre Sorhus](http://sindresorhus.com/hi/) for that.

Whenever one wants to color the terminal, as in styling the strings on the console the first module that would come to mind is [colors.js](https://github.com/Marak/colors.js) but one of the major drawbacks with that being it extending `String.portotye` or be [these](https://github.com/yeoman/yo/issues/68) problems.

Installing chalk is like any other module: `npm install --save chalk`

Apart from allow the normal styling syntax, it also provides multiple styles, nested styles and multiple arguments.

__For example:__

```javascript
var chalk = require('chalk');

console.log(  chalk.blue.bgRed.bold('Hello world!')  );

console.log(  chalk.red('Hello', chalk.underline('world') + '!')  );

```

Here is a simple snippet for printing all of the styles it provides:

```javascript
var chalk = require('chalk');

Object.keys(chalk.styles).forEach(function(style) {
    if( style !== "reset") {
      process.stdout.write(chalk[style](style) + ' ');
    }
});
```
