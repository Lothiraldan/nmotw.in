This module lets you to have markdown syntax in your debug logs! It had `['log', 'info', 'warn', 'error']` as it's logging levels.

One can also prefix the log message, it has support for various terminals `/^screen|^xterm|^vt100|color|ansi|cygwin|linux/` and also runs
in the browser env.


__Install it:__ `npm install --save logdown`

```js
var Logdown = require('logdown');
var debug = new Logdown({ prefix: 'meow' });

debug.log('lorem *ipsum*');
debug.info('I can haz _info_');
debug.warn('shall I `highlight` your code?');
```

__GIF FTW:__
